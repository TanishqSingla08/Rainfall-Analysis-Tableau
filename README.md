# Rainfall Analysis Using Tableau
---
## Overview
---
This repository contains a project that analysis the monthly rainfall of Indian States from the year 1901 to 2017.

Analysis is done using a Tableau Dashboard where we can select choose any state and year from the given and accordingly the monthly bar chart will vary. The other charts also vary when one data is selected from a chart.

The dataset was first pre-processed in R using dplyr and was converted in a single dataset which was used in Tableau.

The dataset was taken from Kaggle. [link](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ayushv322/indian-states-monthly-rainfall-from-1901-to-2017)
